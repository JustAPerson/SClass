		SClass - Stravantian Classes

	This repository is based on the work of Mark Langen (AKA Stravant/XlegoX).
He has yet to publish this code under his GitHub account, but I am interested
in it, so I'll be doing some work with it here.

I've used this class system in the past, and it was quite nice.
I really liked it. However, I do remember tinkering around and making changes,
so I'll be keeping track of those here. Files like ./etc/example.lua 
and ./etc/test.lua will not be updated as I modify things. They are simply
there to document the past.
